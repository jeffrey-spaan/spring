## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. Your report will be handled with the utmost priority and confidentiality. 

Please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a GitHub issue.**
   For security reasons, vulnerabilities should not be disclosed in public issues or pull requests.

   - A description of the vulnerability.

4. We will review your report and provide a response as soon as possible. Depending on the severity, we will work with you to disclose the vulnerability in a responsible manner.

## Responsible Disclosure

We will make every effort to address vulnerabilities promptly and responsibly. After the vulnerability is fixed, we will:

- Coordinate with the reporter to ensure proper disclosure.
- Release a patch or mitigation as needed.
- Provide a public advisory if necessary (depending on the severity and impact).

We ask that reporters allow us a reasonable period of time to resolve the issue before disclosing any details publicly.
